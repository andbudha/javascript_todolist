# javascript_todolist
It is an ordinary todo-list on vanilla js and a faint touch of bootstrap and fontawesome. 
You can add new tasks to the list and remove them. As soon as the number of tasks in the lists is equal to 5, a new input for task filtering will be displayed. 
When the number of tasks in the list goes down to less than 5, the filtering input will disappear.
Enjoy it!
